<h2>Basic block level elements this is update from me</h2>
<p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to it, let us mention that this
    page was primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it
    for various other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays various HTML elements
    by default. It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML format to other formats, since some
    elements can go wrong then.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that the set of elements tested is not exhaustive
    in any sense. I have selected those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet
    rules, in my opionion.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is a block quotation containing a single paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not
        <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this page does not use
        HTML markup very normally anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following contains address information about the author, in an <code>address</code>
    element.</p>
<address>
    <a href="../personal.html" lang="fi" hreflang="en">Jukka Korpela</a>,
    <a href="mailto:jukkakk@gmail.com">jukkakk@gmail.com</A><br>

</address>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing
    between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't
    guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>

<ul>
    <li> One.
    <li> Two.
    <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short items lists look better
        if they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical
        spacing between items.
    <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
        Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
</ul>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>The following table has a caption. The first row and the first column
    contain table header cells (<code>th</code> elements) only; other cells
    are data cells (<code>td</code> elements):</p>

<table
    summary="Each row names a Nordic country and specifies its total area and land area, in square kilometers">
    <caption>Sample table: Areas of the Nordic countries, in sq km</caption>
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">Country</th>
        <th scope="col">Total area</th>
        <th scope="col">Land area</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td scope="row">Denmark</td>
        <td> 43,070 </td>
        <td> 42,370 </td>

        <td>449,964 </td>
        <td>410,928 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Character test</h2>
<p>The following table has some sample characters with
    annotations. If the browser&#8217;s default font does not
    contain all of them, they may get displayed using backup fonts.
    This may cause stylistic differences, but it should not
    prevent the characters from being displayed at all.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Char.</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ê</td>
        <td>e with circumflex</td>
        <td>Latin 1 character, should be ok</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&#8212;</td>
        <td>em dash</td>
        <td>Windows Latin 1 character, should be ok, too</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&#x100;</td>
        <td>A with macron (line above)</td>
        <td>Latin Extended-A character, not present in all fonts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&Omega;</td>
        <td>capital omega</td>
        <td>A Greek letter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&#x2212;</td>
